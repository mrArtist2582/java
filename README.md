# ðŸš€ Java Project Repository

Welcome to my **Java Repository**! This repository contains various **Java programs and projects** covering fundamental and advanced Java concepts.

## ðŸ“Œ About Java
Java is a **powerful, object-oriented programming language** designed for flexibility, security, and cross-platform compatibility. It follows the **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)** principle, meaning Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
